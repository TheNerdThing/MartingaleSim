# MartingaleSim
A simple program that simulates a player doubling his bet after each loss. 


This is a simple hodge project that was thrown together rather quickly to test the martingale betting system in roulte. The game is 
simple, a number bettwen 0 and 100 is picked and if the number is greater than 50 the player wins 2x their bet, otherwise the player wins 
nothing.  The game is repeated untill eihter the player meets a goal, or does not have enough money to continue.
